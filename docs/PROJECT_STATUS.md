## Next 5 Tasks

1. **Survival Mode** — 1-heart game that pulls from the same word pool as Speed Mode; game ends on first wrong answer; track longest survival run on Firestore leaderboard.
2. **Speed Mode high score animation** — Confetti burst + gold shimmer when new record is set on the results screen.
3. **Arcade tab badge** — Show a "NEW!" or flame badge on the Arcade bottom-nav icon until first visit (store first-visit flag in SharedPreferences).
4. **Push notification for review reminders** — Use `firebase_messaging` to send a daily local reminder if the user has >5 review words but hasn't opened the app.
5. **Shorebird patch counter** — Integrate `shorebird_code_push` to auto-increment the patch number in SharedPreferences when a new OTA patch is detected, so the version display in Settings and Drawer footer updates automatically.

## Firebase Integration (v3)

### Authentication
| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| Firebase project | `thailingo-5d117` (asia-southeast1) |
| Google Sign In | ✅ Implemented (`FirebaseService.signInWithGoogle()`) |
| Guest mode | ✅ Implemented (skips login, local-only) |
| Auth check on launch | ✅ Splash navigates to Login / ProfileSetup / Home |
| Sign out | ✅ Via ProfileScreen |

> ⚠️ **Google Sign In requires SHA-1** — Add your debug key's SHA-1 to the Firebase Console → Project Settings → Android app, then re-download `google-services.json`. Get debug SHA-1 with: `keytool -list -v -keystore ~/.android/debug.keystore -alias androiddebugkey -storepass android -keypass android`

### Firestore Collections
| Collection | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `users/{uid}` | Full user profile, streak, stageProgress, friends list |
| `leaderboard/{uid}` | Mirrored stats for fast leaderboard queries |

### New Screens (v3)
| Screen | File | Status |
|--------|------|--------|
| Login | `login_screen.dart` | ✅ Thai flag theme, Google Sign In, Guest mode |
| Profile Setup | `profile_setup_screen.dart` | ✅ Avatar grid + username — shown on first login |
| Leaderboard | `leaderboard_screen.dart` | ✅ 3 tabs: Global / Weekly / Friends, real-time streams |
| Profile | `profile_screen.dart` | ✅ Stats, rank, avatar change, sign out |

### New Services (v3)
| Service | File | Notes |
|---------|------|-------|
| FirebaseService | `firebase_service.dart` | Singleton; Google Sign In, auth state |
| UserService | `user_service.dart` | Firestore CRUD; leaderboard streams; friends |

### Next 5 Tasks
1. **Upload lessons to Firestore** — run `python scripts/upload_lessons_to_firestore.py` (requires service account key + `pip install firebase-admin`)
2. **Add Firestore index** for `lessons` collection — Firestore Console → Indexes → add composite index on `id ASC`
3. **Add SHA-1 fingerprint** to Firebase Console to enable Google Sign In on device
4. **Create Firestore indexes** for leaderboard — deploy via Firebase CLI or follow links in Android logcat
5. **iOS setup** — add `GoogleService-Info.plist` + update `firebase_options.dart` for iOS

### Known Issues (v3)
- Weekly leaderboard requires a Firestore composite index on `leaderboard` collection (`weeklyXp DESC`). Follow the error link in logcat to auto-create it.
- `getFriends` limits to first 30 friends (Firestore `whereIn` limit).
- `getUserRank` and `getWeeklyRankInfo` use `count()` aggregate — requires Firestore billing plan (Blaze) for large datasets; free tier supports up to 1M reads/day.

---

## v4 Changes — 2026-06-23

### Fix: Conversation Mode Audio
- **Root cause**: `_playCurrentLine()` was using `line.audioFile` to look up a local asset; all conversation lines shared the same (or a missing) audio file so the same sound played every time.
- **Fix**: Added `AudioService.playThai(String thaiText)` method that always uses Google TTS directly (`translate.google.com/translate_tts`), bypassing local file lookup entirely. Each conversation line now plays its own Thai text via TTS.
- **Replay button**: Added 🔊 speaker icon to each dialogue bubble in `_DialogueBubble`. Tapping it calls `AudioService().playThai(line.thai)` to replay that specific line.

### Feature: Bug Reporting System
- **`BugReportService`** (`services/bug_report_service.dart`) — singleton that submits reports to Firestore `bug_reports` collection; falls back to SharedPreferences queue when offline; `retryPendingReports()` called on app start from `main.dart`.
- **`BugReport` model** — fields: type, description, lessonId, lessonName, screen, appVersion, userId, deviceInfo, status, timestamp.
- **`showBugReportDialog()`** (`screens/bug_report_dialog.dart`) — shared dialog with bug type dropdown (6 options), multiline description field, auto-filled lesson/screen/version/device info. Shows confirmation snackbar on submit.
- **Settings screen** — "Report a Bug 🐛" action tile added to Account section. "🐛 View Bug Reports" dev button added to Developer Mode section.
- **Lesson screen** — 🐛 icon button added to top bar next to the close (X) button; opens bug report dialog pre-filled with lesson name and ID.
- **`BugReportsScreen`** (`screens/bug_reports_screen.dart`) — developer-only screen (accessed via Settings → Developer Mode); streams all reports from Firestore ordered by timestamp; shows open bug count banner; tap any report to mark as "fixed", "won't fix", or reopen.

---

## v5 Changes — 2026-06-23

### Feature: Weekly XP Rank Banner
- **`UserService.getWeeklyRankInfo(uid)`** — new method that reads the user's weekly XP from `leaderboard/{uid}`, counts how many users have higher `weeklyXp`, and returns `{'rank': int, 'weeklyXp': int}`. Returns `null` if weeklyXp is 0 or on any error.
- **Home screen banner** — shown as a `SliverToBoxAdapter` below the streak banner. Appears when the user's weekly rank improves (lower rank number than the last stored value in SharedPreferences key `weekly_rank_last`). Auto-dismisses after 6 seconds. Has a "View" button that opens the leaderboard and a dismiss ×.
- **Banner messages** by rank tier: 🥇 #1 · 🏆 top 3 · 🔥 top 10 · 📈 any improvement.
- **`_WeeklyRankBanner`** widget — gold/amber themed container, shows rank + weekly XP earned, consistent animation with streak banner (fadeIn + slideY).
- **Persistence**: SharedPreferences key `weekly_rank_last` stores the last shown rank; banner only fires again when rank numerically improves (prevents re-showing same rank on every app open).

---

## v6 Changes — 2026-06-23

### 1. Star System Rework
- **New star rules** — stars are now based on play count + accuracy:
  - ⭐ 1 star: complete the lesson once (any score)
  - ⭐⭐ 2 stars: complete 2+ times OR get 80%+ accuracy on any attempt
  - ⭐⭐⭐ 3 stars: complete 3+ times OR get 100% accuracy on any attempt
- **`LessonProgress.timesCompleted`** — new field added; migrates from old data using stored star count as estimate.
- **`ProgressService._computeStars()`** — static helper implementing the new rules.
- **Unlock gates updated** — individual lessons now unlock with 1 star (was 3); Stage 2 unlocks when all 22 Stage 1 lessons have 1+ star.
- **`allStage1Mastered` / `allStage2Mastered`** — new getters for the 3-star achievement checks; `allStage1Complete` / `allStage2Complete` now mean "1 star each" (for unlock gates).
- **Result screen** — `timesCompleted` and `newStars` passed from `lesson_screen.dart`; shows "Completed X/3" pill with next-star hint below the star row.
- **Home hex map** — stars now shown below ALL unlocked lessons (not just completed ones).
- **Dev unlock** — `unlockAllLessons()` now sets `timesCompleted = 3`.

### 2. Match Pairs Scoring Fix
- **`PairsScreen.onComplete`** signature changed from `void Function(bool)` to `void Function(int correct, int total)`.
- **Score calculation**: `correct = (totalPairs - mistakes).clamp(0, totalPairs)` — each mistake costs one point.
- **`_onPairsComplete(int, int)`** added to `lesson_screen.dart` — adds all pairs to `_totalAnswered` / `_correct` (each pair is its own point), and loses one heart per wrong match.
- **`review_screen.dart`** — updated to use the new pairs callback signature.

### 3. Patch Notes / Changelog System
- **`PatchNotesService`** (`services/patch_notes_service.dart`) — singleton; reads/writes Firestore `patch_notes` collection; tracks read versions in SharedPreferences (`patch_notes_read_v1`); seeds two initial versions (1.0.0 and 1.0.1) on first run from `main.dart`.
- **`WhatsNewScreen`** (`screens/whats_new_screen.dart`) — full changelog accessible from Settings → "What's New 📋".
- **`WhatsNewDialog`** — popup shown automatically on home screen load when there are unread notes; marks notes as read on dismiss.
- **`showAddPatchNoteDialog()`** — developer-only dialog to add new patch notes to Firestore.
- **Settings screen** — "What's New 📋" action tile added to Account section; "📋 Add Patch Note" dev button added.
- **Home screen** — checks for unread notes once per app session after `_load()` completes.

### 4. Typing Challenge Improvements
- **Fuzzy matching** — threshold raised from fixed `≤2` to `≤30% of answer length` (clamped 2-8); common romanization variants accepted: ph/p, aa/a, th/t, ee/i, oo/u, dt/t, kh/k.
- **Hint system** — 💡 Hint button shown below input field; level 1 shows first letter of each syllable; level 2 shows first 3 letters; max 2 hints per question; using a hint reduces XP reward by 5 (from 10 to 5).

---

## v7 Changes — 2026-06-23

### Muay Thai Mascot Redesign
- **`_MascotPainter` rewritten** — full CustomPainter replacement in `lib/ui/widgets/thai_mascot.dart`. New fighter draws: red Muay Thai shorts with gold waistband and center stripe, athletic trapezoid torso with muscle line, skin-tone arms in a Muay Thai guard stance (upper arm down → forearm back up → fist), white hand wraps with red stripe, oval head with short dark hair, red mongkol headband with gold border and center jewel, angled brows for focused expression. Mood variants: guard stance (happy/neutral), fists raised high (excited), drooping arms (sad), guard + one raised fist (encouraging).
- **Colors** — mongkol red `#B5001C`, mongkol gold `#D4A017`, skin `#D4956A`, dark hair/pupils `#1A0A00`.

### Header Layout Rework
- **Speech bubble moved LEFT of mascot** — `home_screen.dart` `_buildHeader()` right section changed from `Column` (bubble above mascot) to `Row` (bubble left → right-pointing tail → mascot right).
- **`_BubbleTailRightPainter`** — new `CustomPainter` in `home_screen.dart` drawing a right-pointing triangle tail; replaces downward tail from the old layout.
- **Mascot repositioned right** — mascot is the rightmost element in the header row; outer section gap reduced from 10px to 6px for tighter layout on small screens.
- **Mascot size** — reduced from 68px to 64px to compensate for the wider horizontal layout.

### Patch Notes
- **v1.0.2 seeded** in `PatchNotesService.seedInitialPatchNotes()` — title "Muay Thai Mascot Update 🥊", type "minor", 4 notes about the mascot/header/speech bubble changes.

---

## v9 Changes — 2026-06-24

### Cloud Content Pipeline
- `LessonService` now loads from **SharedPreferences cache → Firestore → local assets** in priority order
- Background Firestore sync on every launch picks up new lessons automatically
- New lessons only need to be added to Firestore — no app release needed
- `Lesson.toJson()` / `Word.toJson()` added for cache serialization

### Audio Caching
- `AudioService._playWordAudio()` now has 4-priority fallback:
  1. Bundled asset (fast, offline)
  2. Disk cache in `documents/audio_cache/` (offline after first play)
  3. Google TTS on-demand + background cache to disk
  4. Silent skip
- `path_provider` added to pubspec.yaml
- Fixes missing audio for lessons 38-43 on users who received code via Shorebird patch (no assets)

### Header Menu Redesign (Section 9)
- Replaced 4 individual icon buttons (Guide, Stats, Leaderboard, Settings) with single `☰` hamburger menu
- Menu opens as a bottom sheet with: Profile, Leaderboard, Guide Book, Settings, Bug Report, What's New, Sign Out / Sign In
- All navigation verified and wired to correct screens

### Developer Mode — Manage Lessons
- New `ManageLessonsScreen` accessible from Dev Mode in Settings
- Lists all lessons (from Firestore or local cache)
- Per-lesson "Upload to Firestore" button and "Upload All" action
- "Add Lesson" dialog for creating new lessons with words
- `scripts/upload_lessons_to_firestore.py` — bulk upload script using Firebase Admin SDK

### Patch Notes
- v1.0.4 "Cloud Content & Auto Audio 🌐" seeded as major patch

## Known Gaps / TODO

- [ ] Audio files not yet generated (run `scripts/generate_audio.py`)
- [ ] Ambient music not yet generated (run `scripts/generate_music.py`)
- [ ] Stage 3 content not yet implemented (placeholder only)
- [ ] pubspec.yaml `assets` section — verify all 42 lesson JSON files and new audio prefixes are listed
- [ ] iOS `Info.plist` and Android `strings.xml` — verify app name is "Thailingo" everywhere
- [ ] Review `kStageLessonIds` in `user_progress.dart` — should list all 37 + 101-105 for achievements
- [ ] Add SHA-1 fingerprint to Firebase Console for Google Sign In to work on device

---

## Architecture Notes

- **Singleton services** with factory constructor (`LessonService()`, `ProgressService()`, etc.)
- **JSON-driven lessons** — every lesson is a self-contained JSON asset
- **SharedPreferences** for all persistence (progress, settings, review queue)
- **just_audio** for audio playback (4 isolated `AudioPlayer` instances)
- **flutter_animate** for entrance animations and combos
- **Stage 0 ID space** — uses 101-105 to avoid collision with Stage 1/2 IDs 1-37
